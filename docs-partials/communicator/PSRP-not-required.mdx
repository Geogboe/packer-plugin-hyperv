- `psrp_host` (string) - The hostname or IP address of the remote host for WSMan connections. If not specified, the IP address is auto-detected. Ignored for `hvsock` transport.

- `psrp_transport` (string) - The PSRP transport to use. Valid values are `wsman` (default) and `hvsock`.
  `wsman` uses WS-Management over HTTP/HTTPS.
  `hvsock` uses Hyper-V sockets to connect directly to the VM without network connectivity (PowerShell Direct).

- `psrp_username` (string) - The username for PSRP authentication. Required for `basic` and `ntlm` auth types. Optional for `kerberos` and `negotiate` (SSO with the logged-in user's Windows credentials when omitted).

- `psrp_password` (string) - The password for PSRP authentication.

- `psrp_port` (int) - The port to connect to. Defaults to `5985` for HTTP and `5986` for HTTPS (WSMan only; ignored for `hvsock`).

- `psrp_use_tls` (bool) - Whether to use TLS/HTTPS for the WSMan connection. When set to `true` and port is `5985`, the port is automatically changed to `5986`. Defaults to `false`.

- `psrp_insecure` (bool) - Whether to skip TLS certificate validation. Defaults to `false`.

- `psrp_auth_type` (string) - The authentication method. Valid values are `basic`, `ntlm`, `negotiate`, `kerberos`. Defaults to `negotiate`.

- `psrp_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The amount of time to wait for the PSRP connection to become available. Defaults to `5m`.

- `psrp_vmid` (string) - The VM GUID to connect to when using `hvsock`. If not specified, the builder automatically detects the GUID of the VM being built.

- `psrp_domain` (string) - The domain name for NTLM or Negotiate authentication.

- `psrp_realm` (string) - The Kerberos realm. Optional (auto-detected via SSPI on Windows).

- `psrp_configuration_name` (string) - The PowerShell configuration/endpoint name to connect to. Used with `hvsock` transport.
