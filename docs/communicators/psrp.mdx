# PSRP Communicator

The Hyper-V plugin supports the PSRP (PowerShell Remoting Protocol) communicator
as an alternative to SSH and WinRM for Windows VMs. PSRP offers two transport modes:

- **WSMan** - Network-based transport over HTTP/HTTPS (WS-Management protocol)
- **HvSocket** - PowerShell Direct via Hyper-V sockets (no network required)

## Why Use PSRP?

| Feature | SSH | WinRM | PSRP |
|---------|-----|-------|------|
| Windows Support | Requires OpenSSH | Native | Native |
| Network Required | Yes | Yes | No (HvSocket) |
| PowerShell Integration | Limited | Good | Best |
| Stream Handling | stdout/stderr only | stdout/stderr only | All 7 PS streams |

For Hyper-V builds, **PSRP with HvSocket transport is recommended** for Windows
VMs. It connects directly through the hypervisor — no network switch, no
firewall rules, no WinRM listener configuration needed.

## HvSocket Transport (Recommended)

HvSocket uses Hyper-V sockets (PowerShell Direct) for communication, requiring
no network connectivity on the guest. The VM GUID is automatically detected:

```hcl
source "hyperv-iso" "windows" {
  vm_name    = "windows-2025"
  iso_url    = "path/to/windows.iso"
  iso_checksum = "sha256:..."

  communicator   = "psrp"
  psrp_transport = "hvsock"
  psrp_username  = "Administrator"
  psrp_password  = var.admin_password
  psrp_timeout   = "10m"

  shutdown_command = "shutdown /s /t 5 /f"
}
```

> **Note:** HvSocket requires a Windows 10 / Server 2016 or newer Hyper-V host
> and the guest must have Hyper-V Integration Services installed (included by
> default in modern Windows).

## WSMan Transport

WSMan uses standard WS-Management over HTTP/HTTPS, similar to WinRM. Use this
when HvSocket is not available (e.g., remote Hyper-V hosts):

```hcl
source "hyperv-iso" "windows" {
  vm_name    = "windows-2025"
  iso_url    = "path/to/windows.iso"
  iso_checksum = "sha256:..."

  communicator   = "psrp"
  psrp_username  = "Administrator"
  psrp_password  = var.admin_password
  psrp_port      = 5985
  psrp_use_tls   = false
  psrp_auth_type = "ntlm"

  shutdown_command = "shutdown /s /t 5 /f"
}
```

## Configuration Reference

The builder docs include PSRP fields via `@include`. The full list of PSRP
options is documented in the builder configuration references:

- [hyperv-iso PSRP fields](../builders/iso.mdx)
- [hyperv-vmcx PSRP fields](../builders/vmcx.mdx)

### Required Options

- `psrp_username` (string) - The username for authentication. Required for
  `basic` and `ntlm` auth types. Optional for `kerberos` and `negotiate`
  (SSO with logged-in user's Windows credentials when omitted).
- `psrp_password` (string) - The password for authentication.

### Transport Options

- `psrp_host` (string) - Hostname or IP for WSMan connections. Auto-detected if not specified. Ignored for `hvsock`.
- `psrp_transport` (string) - `wsman` (default) or `hvsock`.
- `psrp_vmid` (string) - VM GUID for HvSocket (auto-detected if not specified).
- `psrp_port` (int) - WSMan port. Default: `5985` (HTTP) or `5986` (HTTPS).
- `psrp_use_tls` (bool) - Use TLS/HTTPS for WSMan. Default: `false`.
- `psrp_insecure` (bool) - Skip TLS certificate validation. Default: `false`.
- `psrp_timeout` (duration) - Connection timeout. Default: `5m`.
- `psrp_configuration_name` (string) - PowerShell configuration/endpoint name.

### Authentication Options

- `psrp_auth_type` (string) - Authentication method: `basic`, `ntlm`,
  `negotiate` (default), or `kerberos`.
- `psrp_domain` (string) - Domain name for NTLM or Negotiate authentication.
- `psrp_realm` (string) - Kerberos realm (auto-detected via SSPI on Windows).

## Authentication Methods

| Method | Field Value | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Negotiate | `negotiate` | Default. Tries Kerberos first, falls back to NTLM |
| NTLM | `ntlm` | Challenge-response, works with local and domain accounts |
| Basic | `basic` | Username + password (avoid over non-TLS connections) |
| Kerberos | `kerberos` | Ticket-based, for Active Directory environments |

Kerberos and Negotiate authentication use the native Windows SSPI subsystem.
When `psrp_username` is omitted, SSPI authenticates with the logged-in user's
credentials (SSO).

## Comparison with WinRM

PSRP provides several advantages over the built-in WinRM communicator:

1. **HvSocket Support** - No network setup required for Hyper-V builds
2. **Rich Stream Handling** - Access to all 7 PowerShell streams (Output, Error,
   Warning, Verbose, Debug, Information, Progress) though Progress is discarded
   by default
3. **Better Error Messages** - Error records include script line numbers and
   stack traces
4. **Native PowerShell** - Commands execute directly in a PSRP runspace rather
   than spawning child processes

## Reconnection Behavior

The PSRP communicator automatically reconnects when the session is lost (e.g.,
during a VM restart from the `windows-restart` provisioner). It polls with a
10-second retry interval until the VM comes back, bounded by `psrp_timeout`.
